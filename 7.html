<!--
Transition: it is the process of changing from one state to another of an item.
The transition() method is available for all selectors and it starts the transition process. This method supports most of the selection methods such as â€“ attr(), style(), etc. But, It does not support the append() and the data() methods, which need to be called before the transition() method.

it provides methods specific to transition like duration(), ease(), etc.
